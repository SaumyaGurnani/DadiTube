# DadiTube ‚Äì Voice-Powered Simple YouTube Search for Elders

**DadiTube** is a voice-enabled, Hindi-friendly video search web app designed to make online video content more accessible for elderly users. Built with simplicity, usability, and empathy at its core, the project was inspired by a personal moment with my grandmother who wanted to watch old Hindi songs ‚Äî but struggled with complex interfaces and small search icons.

This app listens to what the user says in Hindi, fetches relevant YouTube results in literally **just 1 click**, and removes the need to type ‚Äî making it intuitive and elder-friendly.

## Problem Statement

Traditional video platforms are not always senior-friendly. Small hidden icons, English-only prompts, and a dependency on typing often create barriers. **DadiTube** addresses this by offering:

- Large Mic icon visible on 1st screen 
- A clean, distraction-free UI
- Hindi voice command support
- Minimal manual interaction
- Large, readable elements
