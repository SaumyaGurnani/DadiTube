# DadiTube – Voice-Powered Simple YouTube Search for Elders

**DadiTube** is a voice-enabled, Hindi-friendly video search web app designed to make online video content more accessible for elderly users. Built with simplicity, usability, and empathy at its core, the project was inspired by a personal moment with my grandmother who wanted to watch old Hindi songs — but struggled with complex interfaces and small search icons.

This app listens to what the user says in Hindi, fetches relevant YouTube results in literally **just 1 click**, and removes the need to type, making it intuitive and elder-friendly.

## Problem Statement

Traditional video platforms are not always senior-friendly. Small hidden icons, English-only prompts, and a dependency on typing often create barriers. **DadiTube** addresses this by offering:

- Large Mic icon visible on 1st screen 
- A clean, distraction-free UI
- Hindi voice command support
- Minimal manual interaction
- Large, readable elements
